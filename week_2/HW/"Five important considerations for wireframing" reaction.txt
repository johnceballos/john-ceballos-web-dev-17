\f0\fs24 \cf0 This article was short and concise about how to go about starting a project and what to consider before-hand. One section particularly stood out to me was the \'93Know Your Tools\'94 section because I have been considering different types of softwares/ accounts to purchase, like the one they mention \'93Omnigraffle\'94. Otherwise yea it\'92s pretty informative and straightforward, I\'92ll probably come back to refer to this advice before a project.}
